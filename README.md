## Ability of Artificial Intelligence to Identify Self-Reported Race in Chest X-Ray Using Pixel Intensity Counts

### Race Pixel Intensity - Converting Image to Gray-Scale Counts and Visualizations.ipynb
This notebook is used to convert a folder path of png images into a DataFrame of gray-scale value counts. Once this conversion is complete, it will save the file to CSV for the other notebook. 
Additional visualizations are displayed.

### Race Pixel Intensity - TensorFlow Black or Other.ipynb
This notebook loads the gray-scale values and runs Keras-tuner to test hyper models, then run feed-forward network and decision tree tests.
